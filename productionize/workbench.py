"""
workbench.py contains the class workbench(), which creates the technical setup. 
The class workbench() allows you to install and manage all the components 
necessary for the successfully productionizing your model.

The components you need are:

1. Docker: as a container technology https://www.docker.com
2. VirtualBox: as a driver https://www.virtualbox.org
3. Minikube: as a local Kubernetes cluster https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/
4. Kubectl: as a Kubernetes CLI https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io

Slots:
--------
wd : str
    Stores the current working directory
current_status : str
    Stores the current status of the minikube cluster
platform : str
    Stores the platform the host is running on
py_version : string
    Stores the version of Python in use
dk_installed : boolean
    Stores if Docker is already installed
vb_installed : boolean
    Stores if VirtualBox is already installed
kc_installed : boolean
    Stores if kubectl is already installed
mk_installed : boolean

kc_prev_installed : boolean
    Stores if kubectl was already installed
mk_prev_installed : boolean
    Stores if minikube was already installed
current_projects : list
    Stores all active projects on the workbench
cpus_used : string
    Stores the CPUs allocated to the workbench

                        productionize is an open-source lightweight ML deployment tool.
                        You can containerize, deploy and ship your model, without ever
                        having to leave your beloved Python.


        Before we start, we will first setup your local workbench. The workbench is a collection of tools
        we need to do all those amazing things. You are running the following setup:

        Platform: {operating_system}
        Python:   {python_version}
        Cores:    {number_cores}

        The main components of the workbench are containerization and orchestration tools. I know there are
        many different tools out there, but we are using:

                  Already on machine      Purpose
        ------------------------------------------------------
        Docker:         {dk_exists}        Containerization
        VirtualBox:     {vb_exists}        Cluster Hypervisor
        Kubectl:        {kc_exists}        Kubernetes CLI
        Minikube:       {mk_exists}        Local Kubernetes


        You can download the missing components and configure them using: workbench.setup(). Don't worry
        though, using workbench.delete(), you will be able to cleanly uninstall all the components again.
